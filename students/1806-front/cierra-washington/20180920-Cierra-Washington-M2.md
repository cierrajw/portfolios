## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

In this module I set out to become more confident as a problem solver, which I think I was able to accomplish. As we learned more about array prototypes, I also set out to become better at understanding those, which I think I was able to do. I feel quite confident with array prototypes.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

I believe that I passed the end of module assessment. I do think that my proctor labeled me thinking through problems as "struggling", but I didn't feel like I was struggling at all. It's possible that I just wasn't moving fast enough, which is an issue that can be fixed with more reps. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual project for the mod was CompleteMe, which was an interesting learning experience.
